Yeah, I'm on the stage right now
Singin' your favorite song
Look in the crowd
And you're nowhere to be found as they sing along
I say you look good without no makeup
No lashes, even better when you wake up
Uh-uh-uh
I see the look on your face
I see you hidin' the hate
I see you lookin' for someone to scoop you right off of your feet
You wanna ride in a Wraith
You wanna go out on dates
You want somebody to come bring you flowers
Someone to talk to for hours
